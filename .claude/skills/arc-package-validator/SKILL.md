# ARC Package Validator

Validates Swift Packages against ARC Labs Studio standards defined in ARCKnowledge.

## Quick Start

**Validate current package:**
```bash
swift .claude/skills/arc-package-validator/scripts/validate.swift .
```

**Validate with automatic fixes:**
```bash
swift .claude/skills/arc-package-validator/scripts/validate.swift . --fix
```

**Validate specific package:**
```bash
swift .claude/skills/arc-package-validator/scripts/validate.swift /path/to/ARCPackageName
```

Or simply ask: "Validate this package against ARC standards" and I'll run the checks automatically.

## Validation Categories

### 📁 Structure (from package-structure.md)
- `Package.swift` with Swift 6.0 and iOS 17+
- `README.md` following ARC Labs template
- `LICENSE` (MIT)
- `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog format)
- `Sources/PackageName/` directory
- `Tests/PackageNameTests/` directory
- `Documentation.docc/` catalog

### ⚙️ Configuration (from arcdevtools.md)
- ARCDevTools as git submodule
- `.swiftlint.yml` present
- `.swiftformat` present
- `.github/workflows/` with CI

### 📖 Documentation (from readme-standards.md)
- Badges: Swift, Platforms, License, Version
- Required sections: Overview, Requirements, Installation, Usage
- DocC with package overview

### 🧹 Code Quality
- SwiftLint passes without errors
- SwiftFormat check passes
- Swift 6 strict concurrency compliance

## Severity Levels

| Level | Icon | Meaning | Action |
|-------|------|---------|--------|
| Error | 🔴 | Blocks release | Must fix before merge to main |
| Warning | 🟡 | Should fix | Fix before next release |
| Info | 🔵 | Suggestion | Optional improvement |

## Fix Mode

The `--fix` flag applies safe automatic fixes:

**Safe fixes (applied automatically):**
- Create missing directories (Documentation.docc/, .github/workflows/)
- Copy template files from ARCDevTools
- Create CHANGELOG.md template
- Initialize empty DocC catalog

**Manual fixes (reported only):**
- Package.swift modifications
- README content changes
- Existing file modifications

## Output

The validator generates a Markdown report with:
- Overall compliance score (percentage)
- Status indicator (✅ Pass / ⚠️ Warnings / ❌ Errors)
- Detailed list of passed checks
- Failed checks with specific fix instructions
- Commands to resolve each issue

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | All checks passed (or only warnings/info) |
| 1 | Has blocking errors (🔴) |
